In the design of this system, it will be made using a nave Bayes algorithm as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) which will detect Man in The Minddle attacks. The first step is to dissect the dataset that is used to learn what is in the dataset. Next is to detect MITM attacks using the nave Bayes algorithm as NIDS. After getting the detection results, it will be analyzed to calculate its accuracy using a confusion matrix.
